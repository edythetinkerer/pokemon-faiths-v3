# Pok√©mon Faiths - Next Steps
## *Building from a Solid Foundation*

---

## ‚úÖ What's Clean & Ready

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå Test chest battle trigger (was broken anyway)
- ‚ùå Battle integration TODOs from main.py
- ‚ùå Confusing half-implemented features

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ All core systems (Veteran, Battle, Save, Movement)
- ‚úÖ Scene transitions (Bedroom ‚Üî Outside ‚Üî Cave)
- ‚úÖ Cave pok√©ball story beat (flags work, just needs reward)
- ‚úÖ Interaction system
- ‚úÖ Pause menu / Settings
- ‚úÖ Debug tools (F1-F3)

## üéØ What to Build Next (In Order)

### **Phase 1: Core Gameplay Loop** (3-5 days)

#### 1. Wild Encounter System ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why First:** Without this, the Veteran System can't shine. Players need multiple battles.

**Implementation:**
- Create `core/wild_encounters.py` (code provided in audit)
- Add step counter to Outside/Cave scenes
- Create 5-6 enemy templates:
  - Weak: Rattata (age 2-4, 2 moves, low stats)
  - Moderate: Pidgey, Ekans (age 5-8, 3 moves)
  - Veteran: Raticate (age 15+, 4 moves, has injuries)
- Trigger battle when encounter rolled

**Test:** Walk around ‚Üí encounter triggers ‚Üí battle starts ‚Üí return to exploration

---

#### 2. Battle Integration (From Encounters) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Connects wild encounters to your existing battle system.

**Implementation:**
```python
# In outside.py/cave.py:
from core.wild_encounters import get_encounter_manager

def update(self, dt):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Check for wild encounter
    if not self.player_locked:  # Only during free movement
        encounter_mgr = get_encounter_manager()
        wild_pokemon = encounter_mgr.step(location='outside')  # or 'cave'
        
        if wild_pokemon:
            self.trigger_battle = True
            self.wild_pokemon = wild_pokemon
            self.running = False
```

```python
# In main.py:
result = game_manager.run_outside_scene(save_data)

if result.get('trigger_battle'):
    # Get player's active Pokemon
    player_pokemon = get_player_active_pokemon(save_data)
    wild_pokemon = result['wild_pokemon']
    
    # Start battle
    battle = BattleScene(player_pokemon, wild_pokemon)
    outcome = battle.run()
    
    # Update battle log
    if outcome != 'retreat':
        log_entry = battle.get_battle_log_entry()
        player_pokemon.add_battle_entry(log_entry)
        update_save_with_battle_results(save_data, player_pokemon)
    
    # Continue exploring
    continue
```

**Test:** Encounter ‚Üí Battle ‚Üí Win/Retreat ‚Üí Resume exploration

---

#### 3. Starter Pok√©mon on First Battle ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Player needs a Pokemon to fight with!

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_player_active_pokemon(save_data):
    """Get or create player's active Pokemon"""
    if not save_data['pokemon']['party']:
        # First battle - create starter
        starter = Pokemon('Charmander', 'Charmy', age_years=1)
        # Save to party
        save_data['pokemon']['party'].append(pokemon_to_dict(starter))
        save_game(save_data)
        logger.info("Created starter Pokemon: Charmander")
    
    # Load from save
    return dict_to_pokemon(save_data['pokemon']['party'][0])
```

**Test:** New game ‚Üí First encounter ‚Üí Starter created ‚Üí Battle works

---

#### 4. Cave Veteran Reward ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Major story beat that currently does nothing.

**Implementation:**
- Use the code from `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT.md` (Fix #3)
- When player takes pok√©ball, create veteran Arcanine:
  - Age 99, hours from death (1% HP)
  - Lost eye, deep scars, broken limb
  - Pre-filled battle log (60+ fights)
  - High veteran score but crippled by injuries
- Add to party as second slot

**Test:** Take pok√©ball ‚Üí Get "Old Warrior" ‚Üí Can use in battle ‚Üí Has unique backstory

---

#### 5. Catch System ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Core Pok√©mon mechanic, enables team building.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to battle scene action menu: Fight / Catch / Switch / Retreat

def attempt_catch(wild_pokemon):
    """Simple catch mechanic"""
    # Base catch rate (higher if low HP)
    hp_modifier = 1.0 - (wild_pokemon.current_hp_percent / 100) * 0.5
    catch_rate = 0.3 * hp_modifier  # 30% at full HP, up to 45% at low HP
    
    if random.random() < catch_rate:
        # Success!
        save_data['pokemon']['party'].append(pokemon_to_dict(wild_pokemon))
        return 'caught'
    else:
        # Failed - Pokemon still attacks
        return 'failed'
```

**Test:** Weaken wild Pokemon ‚Üí Attempt catch ‚Üí Success/Fail ‚Üí Add to party

---

### **Phase 2: Polish & Tuning** (2-3 days)

#### 6. Movement Feel ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Change in `constants.py`:
```python
PLAYER_SPEED = 2.2  # Was 1.4 - much snappier now
ANIMATION_SPEED = 0.20  # Was 0.15 - faster animation
```

Enable camera smoothing in `entities.py`:
```python
self.camera = Camera(self.player, smoothing=True, smoothing_speed=5.0)
```

**Test:** Movement feels responsive, not sluggish

---

#### 7. Party Management UI ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** Need to view/switch Pokemon.

**Implementation:**
- Add "Party" option to pause menu
- Create `party_menu.py`:
  - List all party members
  - Show descriptive stats (no numbers)
  - View injuries and battle history summary
  - Switch active Pokemon

**Test:** ESC ‚Üí Party ‚Üí View Pokemon ‚Üí Switch active

---

#### 8. Move Expansion ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why:** More variety in battles.

**Implementation:**
- Expand `moves.py` database from 7 to 20-25 moves
- Add status moves (buffs, debuffs)
- Balance damage values through testing
- Wild Pokemon get moves based on species

**Test:** Battles feel varied, types matter

---

### **Phase 3: Content & Story** (Ongoing)

#### 9. More Wild Pokemon Species ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Expand encounter tables to 12-15 species
- Different species per location
- Rare spawns (5% chance of veteran)

#### 10. Basic Items ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Potion (heal outside battle)
- Pok√©ball (catch Pokemon)
- Inventory system

#### 11. Environmental Storytelling ‚≠ê
- More interactive objects in scenes
- Lore through item descriptions
- Dark atmosphere maintained
