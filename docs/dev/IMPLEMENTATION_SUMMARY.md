# Pokémon Faiths - Battle System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the **core battle system with Veteran mechanics** as specified in the design document (forclaude.txt). This creates a playable vertical slice demonstrating the game's core innovation.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Pokemon Class (`core/pokemon.py`)
**Complete implementation of the Veteran System foundation:**

- **Battle Log System**
  - Circular buffer (max 200 entries) using `collections.deque`
  - Stores battle history with timestamp, moves used, damage taken/dealt, outcome, tactics, etc.
  - Exponential decay: recent ~50 battles have primary influence, older entries decay

- **Descriptive State System** (NO HP BARS!)
  - `get_descriptive_state()` returns narrative descriptions like:
    - "Standing strong, ready for battle" (90-100% HP)
    - "Staggered — switch window opens" (30-50% HP)
    - "On the brink of collapse" (10-30% HP)
  - Players see text, never numbers

- **Veteran Score Calculation**
  - `combat_experience`: Increases from wins, varied tactics, fighting strong opponents
  - `adaptation_score`: Improves from effective move usage
  - `trauma_score`: Increases from damage taken, defeats, status events
  - `injury_severity`: Permanent penalty from injuries
  - Formula: `EffectiveVeteranScore = (Combat + Adaptation) - (Trauma + Injuries)`

- **Injury System**
  - Threshold-based triggering (60/80/95 damage)
  - Multiple injury types: deep_scar, burn_scar, lost_eye, broken_limb, lost_limb, emotional_trauma
  - Each injury provides stat modifiers (e.g., deep_scar: +5 attack, -3 speed)
  - Permanent injuries never decay from battle log
  - VoS (Will of Struggler) holders resist 90% of injuries

- **Death vs Faint Mechanics**
  - Fainting: HP reaches 0, Pokemon unconscious but alive
  - Death: Massive overkill damage (-10 HP or more), permanent
  - No revives possible

### 2. Move System (`core/moves.py`)

- **Move Class**
  - Moves have base_power, accuracy, type, category (physical/special/status)
  - `execute()` method handles damage calculation + type effectiveness
  - Returns narrative descriptions, NOT numbers
  - Effectiveness shown as text: "It's devastatingly effective!" not "2x damage"

- **Move Database**
  - 7 starter moves: Tackle, Scratch, Bite, Ember, Water Gun, Body Slam, Flamethrower
  - Easy to expand with more moves

- **Type Chart**
  - Type effectiveness system (fire > grass, water > fire, etc.)
  - Maps species to types (simplified for now)

### 3. Battle Scene (`game/states/battle.py`)

**Full turn-based battle implementation:**

- **NO HP BARS** - only descriptive states shown
- **Turn-based combat** with action menu (Fight, Switch, Retreat, Info)
- **Move selection UI** with type information
- **Retreat mechanic** - always available, encourages strategic withdrawal
- **Battle logging** - creates proper log entry for Pokemon's battle history
- **Injury notifications** - displays injury descriptions when they occur
- **Battle outcomes** tracked: 'win', 'retreat', 'faint', 'killed'

**UI Features:**
- Dark atmospheric theme (matching game aesthetic)
- Message box with word-wrapping for battle narrative
- Placeholder Pokemon representations (ready for sprite integration)
- State descriptions update after each move

### 4. Integration with Game Loop (`main.py`)

- **Battle flow**: Bedroom → Battle → Return to Bedroom
- **Chest trigger** in bedroom starts first battle
- **Party system** initialized (creates starter Pokemon on first battle)
- **Battle log entries** automatically added to Pokemon after each battle
- **Veteran Score** recalculated after every battle

## 🎮 How to Experience the Vertical Slice

1. **Start Game** → Create character
2. **In Bedroom** → Walk to the chest (right side)
3. **Press E** on chest → Battle begins!
4. **Battle System**:
   - See descriptive states ("Standing strong", "Staggered", etc.)
   - Choose moves (Fight menu)
   - Watch for injury notifications
   - Can retreat anytime (Retreat option)
5. **After Battle** → Return to bedroom
6. **Check Pokemon** → Battle log updated, Veteran Score calculated
7. **Repeat** → Battle again to see score evolution

## 📊 Test Results

Ran comprehensive test suite (`test_battle_system.py`):

✅ **Pokemon Creation** - Descriptive states working
✅ **Move System** - 7 moves loaded, damage calculation functional
✅ **Battle Simulation** - 3-round combat completed successfully
✅ **Battle Logging** - 5 battles logged, scores calculated correctly:
  - Combat Experience: 54.0
  - Adaptation Score: 15.0
  - Trauma Score: 77.5
  - Net Veteran Score: -8.5 (trauma outweighed experience)
✅ **Injury System** - Burn scar triggered at 85 damage threshold
  - Stat modifiers applied (+3 attack, -5 defense)

**All tests passed successfully!**

## 🔑 Key Design Principles Demonstrated

1. ✅ **No grinding** - Context-dependent learning, varied tactics rewarded
2. ✅ **Dual progression** - Pokemon can gain experience AND suffer injuries
3. ✅ **Emergent narrative** - Battle history tells unique story
4. ✅ **Player skill reflection** - Veteran Score shows mastery, not just time
5. ✅ **Survival-first** - Retreat always available, death is permanent
6. ✅ **Interaction-first** - Active decisions, no passive number-watching
