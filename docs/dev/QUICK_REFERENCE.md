## üìä Key Metrics

**Total Lines:** ~8,500  
**Development Time:** 2 days (as of Oct 3, 2025)  
**Core Systems:** 100% complete ‚úÖ  
**Content:** 10% complete  
**Polish:** 30% complete  

**Time to Playable:** ~1 week  
**Time to Demo:** ~2-3 weeks  

---

## üí° Quick Tips

1. **Always test after changes** - Run the game frequently
2. **Use the logger** - Helps debug issues quickly
3. **Check the audit** - Full code examples for every feature
4. **Start simple** - Get it working, polish later
5. **Playtest yourself** - Trust your own feel

---

## üé® Design Principles

1. **Consequence > Convenience** - Every choice matters
2. **Player Skill = Progression** - Not grinding
3. **Survival First** - Retreat is valid
4. **History Shapes Identity** - Battle log tells stories
5. **Interaction-First** - Active engagement always

---

## üî• Core Innovation: Veteran System

**Instead of XP/Levels:**
- Circular battle log (max 200 entries)
- Exponential decay (recent battles matter most)
- Score = (Combat Exp + Adaptation) - (Trauma + Injuries)
- Permanent injuries never decay
- Dual progression: Can get stronger AND weaker

**This is what makes your game unique!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### "Asset not found" errors
**Fix:** Check `assets/` folder structure matches code paths

### Movement feels sluggish
**Fix:** Change `PLAYER_SPEED` to 2.2 in `constants.py`

### Battle doesn't start from encounters
**Fix:** Not implemented yet - see `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT.md` Fix #1

### Cave pok√©ball does nothing
**Fix:** Not implemented yet - see `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT.md` Fix #3

### Save file corrupted
**Fix:** Delete `saves/save_data.json` and start fresh

## üé® Customization Quick Reference

### Adjust Movement Speed

base_encounter_rate = 0.05  # 5% per step
```

### Adjust Injury Thresholds
**File:** `core/pokemon.py`

INJURY_THRESHOLD_MINOR = 60
INJURY_THRESHOLD_MAJOR = 80
INJURY_THRESHOLD_CATASTROPHIC = 95
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before implementing a feature, test:
- [ ] Does it run without errors?
- [ ] Does it integrate with saves?
- [ ] Does it work after reload?
- [ ] Is logging working properly?
- [ ] Does it feel good to the player?

---

## üìù Code Style Notes

- **Logging:** Use `logger.info()`, `logger.warning()`, `logger.error()`
- **Constants:** ALL_CAPS in `constants.py`
- **Asset Loading:** Always use `get_asset_manager()`
- **Save/Load:** Always use `get_save_manager()`
- **Error Handling:** Try/except with logger for all I/O
- **Comments:** Explain WHY, not WHAT

---

## üéÆ Playtesting Focus Areas

When testing, focus on:
1. **Feel** - Is movement responsive?
2. **Clarity** - Are descriptive states clear?
3. **Consequence** - Do injuries feel meaningful?
4. **Progression** - Does Veteran Score change noticeably?
5. **Story** - Do battles create emergent narratives?
