# âœ… Wild Encounters Implemented!

## What Was Added

### 1. **Cave Redesign**
- âœ… New cave floor tile (`cave_tile.png`)
- âœ… Grass patches in cave for encounters (3 patches, 23 tiles total)
- âœ… Darker grass tiles (60% brightness) to fit cave atmosphere

### 2. **Encounter System**
**Step Counter:**
- Random 5-15 steps between encounters
- Only counts when moving on grass
- Resets after each encounter

**Wild Pokemon Pool (Cave):**
- Zubat (Lv. 3-6)
- Gastly (Lv. 4-7) 
- Haunter (Lv. 5-8)
- Misdreavus (Lv. 4-7)

### 3. **Grass Locations**
```
Left patch:    (5,3) to (7,5)  - 9 tiles
Center patch:  (9,4) to (11,5) - 6 tiles
Right patch:   (13,6) to (15,8) - 9 tiles
```

### 4. **How It Works**
1. Player walks on dark grass in cave
2. Every step increments counter
3. After 5-15 steps â†’ Wild encounter!
4. Shows message: "A wild [Pokemon] appeared!"
5. Counter resets

## Current Status

**Working:**
- âœ… Grass patches visible in cave
- âœ… Step detection when moving
- âœ… Encounter triggering
- âœ… Random Pokemon selection
- âœ… Message display

**TODO (Next Step):**
- ðŸ”² Connect to battle system
- ðŸ”² Give player starter Pokemon (from old man's PokÃ©ball)
- ðŸ”² Actual battle when encounter triggers

## Test It

```bash
python run.py
```

**To test:**
1. Enter cave
2. Walk on dark grass patches
3. After 5-15 steps â†’ Encounter message!
4. Press ESC/E to close and continue

## What's Next?

**Option A: Give Player Starter** (30 min)
- When taking old man's PokÃ©ball â†’ Add Pokemon to party
- Could be special "Corrupted" starter

**Option B: Connect to Battle** (1 hour)
- Hook encounter â†’ Battle system
- Need to ensure player has at least 1 Pokemon

Recommend doing **Option A first** so player can actually battle! ðŸŽ®
